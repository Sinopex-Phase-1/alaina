              Massage is a treatment that uses different kinds of physical
              contact to relax, revive and heal the body. It is used to treat a
              wide range of emotional and physical health problems and is one of
              the most popular treatments on a spa menu.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h4>What is&nbsp;massage therapy?</h4>
            <p>
              Massage is the stroking, kneading, warming, rolling and pressing
              of skin and muscles.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are lots of different kinds of massage, each with broadly
              different origins and aims - some focus on soothing&nbsp;muscle
              pain; others on increasing energy levels; some aim to improve a
              specific physical condition; others simply to help you relax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Massage makes you feel good in lots of ways, and can have a
              positive effect on your&nbsp;whole body&nbsp;- your bones, your
              muscles, your heart, your skin, your breathing, digestion, and
              your mental health.
            </p>
            <p>Massage works in various ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It r<strong>elaxes and refreshes</strong> tired or knotted
                muscles
              </li>
              <li>It increases blood circulation</li>
              <li>
                It stimulates deep circulation, both of blood and lymph which
                helps your body to heal, and generally work more efficiently
              </li>
              <li>
                It encourages your <strong>body to produce endorphins</strong> -
                the natural chemicals in your body that make you feel happy
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It's instinctive to give someone a hug or a pat on the back to
              comfort or reassure them; in some ways, massage is a formal
              version of that instinct.
            </p>

            <h4>What are the&nbsp;health&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;of massage?</h4>
            <p>
              In its various forms, theraputic massage can help to cure and
              relieve a wide range of complaints. Research shows that it is
              particularly good at{" "}
              <strong>relieving stress-related problems</strong>, from anxiety
              and panic attacks, through to asthma, constipation and high blood
              pressure. It is effective at providing pain relief - treating
              chronic pain,&nbsp;back pain and even arthritis. It is also being
              used more and more with stroke and cancer patients and with people
              with dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Massage encourages&nbsp;blood flow, which increases the amount of
              oxygen and nutrients that reach your organs and tissues. Whilst
              massage encourages your body to circulate the "good stuff"; it
              also encourages it to get rid of the "bad stuff" -&nbsp;waste
              products, toxins, carbon dioxide, and excess water. Stimulating
              the&nbsp;nervous system&nbsp;and improving the&nbsp;lymphatic
              system&nbsp;will also boost the&nbsp;immune system.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              It can be used to treat specific physical injuries or
              difficulties, and to help with rehabilitation after someone has
              had a&nbsp;sports&nbsp;injury. It can also help prevent further
              muscle or tissue damage and improve an athlete's&nbsp;range of
              motion.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the greatest effects of
              most&nbsp;complementary&nbsp;massages is that it can&nbsp;
              <strong>make you feel much better about yourself</strong>, more
              relaxed in your own skin, calm and peaceful.
            </p>
            <h4>Before you go</h4>
            <p>
              Massages vary, and you'll have to bear different things in mind
              depending on what kind you're having. However, generally speaking
              you should wear&nbsp;loose-fitting&nbsp;clothes - you can keep
              your clothes on for some forms of massage; for others, you will
              take them off, or just wear a towel.
            </p>
            <h4>Precautions</h4>
            <p>
              Before any massage treatment, avoid large meals or alcohol. It's
              also a good idea to drink plenty of water, which will help your
              body to flush the toxins out of your body.
            </p>
            <p>You should always tell your therapist in advance if you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are, or think you might be,pregnant</li>
              <li>
                have any medical conditions or are receiving any treatment or
                medication
              </li>
              <li>have recently had an injury or operation</li>
              <li>are allergic to anything, particularly skin allergies</li>
              <li>have any broken skin or sores on your scalp</li>
              <li>have a fever or infection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>as this may affect the kind of oil and treatment you receive.</p>
            <p>

                alt="Massage treatment in action "
                src="https://goodspaguide.co.uk/images/uploads/Features/Resized_for_new_site_/massage-your-questions-answered.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <h4>What to expect</h4>
            <p>
              Whatever kind of massage you are having, the masseur should{" "}
              <strong>ask you some basic questions</strong> about your medical
              history, lifestyle and general health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Massages usually take place on a&nbsp;massage table&nbsp;or bed in
              a private area.&nbsp;Massage therapists&nbsp;will massage you with
              their bare hands, and possibly with their feet or elbows as well.
              They may use some&nbsp;massage oil&nbsp;to make it easier to glide
              their hands across your skin. The strength of pressure will vary
              according to the massage-type and the&nbsp;parts of the
              body&nbsp;they are&nbsp;massaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              The length of sessions varies. Treatments can last from{" "}
              <strong>half an hour to half a day</strong>, depending on what
              kind of massage you are having and what&nbsp;specific
              areas&nbsp;are being massaged. Whatever it is, make sure you allow
              yourself time to get ready and get settled, as well as time to
              wind down afterwards.
            </p>
            <h4>Hot tip!</h4>
            <p>
              Get plenty of information in advance about the kind of products
              being used or any precautions they might need to take; for
              example, tell them if you are allergic to anything.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <h4>
              <img
                alt="Deeply relaxing massage "
                src="https://goodspaguide.co.uk/images/uploads/Features/Resized_for_new_site_/deep-tissue-massage.jpg"
              />
            </h4>
            <h4>Afterwards</h4>
            <p>
              You can expect to <strong>feel relaxed and calm</strong> after a
              massage. After some, you may feel a little achey, after others so
              relaxed that you are a bit vague or sleepy. On the other hand,
              some massages will leave you feeling really energised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever it is, try to arrange to have your massage when you have
              a little time to enjoy its benefits. It may not be a good idea to
              plan an important presentation, host a children's party or take a
              three-hour drive up the M6 to visit your ex-husband immediately
              afterwards.{" "}
              <strong>Give yourself plenty of time to wind down</strong>. Think
              of it in the same way as you would a "cool down" after exercising;
              the massage will do you a lot more good if you do. A good spa will
              offer you a shower, and even a lie-down after your massage; don't
              waste the opportunity of extending your "me-time".
